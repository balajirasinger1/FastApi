FastAPI CRUD Application
This FastAPI application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing two entities: Items and User ClockIn Records. The application uses MongoDB as the database, and FastAPI's integrated Swagger UI for API documentation.

Project Overview
The application consists of two main parts:

Items API: Handles item-related data with features like creating, updating, deleting, filtering, and aggregation.
ClockIn Records API: Manages user clock-in data with similar CRUD operations and filtering capabilities.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed on your system
MongoDB instance, either local or MongoDB Atlas
pip for Python package management
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies: Run the following command in your project directory to install required Python packages:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory.
Add the following line to the .env file, replacing <your-mongo-uri> with your actual MongoDB connection string:
makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
Project Setup
Creating the MongoDB URI
Go to MongoDB Atlas and create a cluster if you donâ€™t have one already.
Under Database Access, create a user with appropriate permissions.
Under Network Access, allow IPs that will access the database.
Connect to your cluster and copy the MongoDB URI, replacing <password> with your password.
Structure
The main application code is in main.py, which contains:

MongoDB connection setup
FastAPI initialization
Pydantic models for input validation
CRUD endpoints
Running the Project
Run the FastAPI Application
Use the following command to start the server locally:

css
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
By default, this will start the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Access the Swagger UI
Once the server is running, you can view and test the APIs in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
